Hello everyone, today is April 27, 2021.

Also this is the third version of vmgirls.py, perhaps it will be the last time I worked on this project.

As I mentioned initially, this program is for practice purpose only.

I read the skills from any other webpages, and trying to put them into practice, therefore I can understand them more efficently.

So far, I've reached all the goals I set, like to program with functions, and also use multithread to improve the effciency.

Same time last year, when I was trying to learn Python from some articles on CSDN and Zhihu, some authors use Vmgirls as a sample.

As you may know, the info on Internet change all the time. By the time he or she wrote that tutorial, that method might work. But years later, when I was trying to follow his path, I found their codes stop working.

Also, the web owner brings lots of "dirty" measures to protect his benefits. It will be too hard for a beginner.

I wouldn't be able to break through it without practicing many weeks on the other websites and projects.

The more I learn, the more powerful I am.

Will, anyway, this is still NOT a masterpiece, maybe just be closer to it since last try. I am practicing my new learned skill on Python and trying to see if I can make things work.

As a giant leap for myself. I'm totally satisfied.
