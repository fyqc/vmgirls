## Images downloaded from www.vmgirls.com using Python 3

Hello everyone, today is June 25, 2021.

Although this is the third version of vmgirls.py, perhaps it will be the last time I worked on this project.

This program is for practice purpose only.

So far, I've reached all the goals I set, like to program with functions, and also use multithread to improve the effciency.

Same time last year, when I was trying to learn Python from some articles on CSDN and Zhihu, some authors use Vmgirls as a sample.

However, the content on Internet keep changing. By the time he or she wrote that tutorial, that method might work. But when I was trying to follow his path, I found their codes stop working.

Also, the web owner brings lots of measures to protect his own benefits. It will be too hard for a beginner.

I wouldn't be able to break through it without practicing many weeks on the other websites and projects.

The more I learn, the more powerful I am.

As a giant leap for myself. I'm totally satisfied.
