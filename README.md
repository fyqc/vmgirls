## Images downloaded from www.vmgirls.com using Python 3

This is NOT a masterpiece, not even close. I am practicing my new learned skill on Python and trying to see if I can make things work. <br>
Believe or not, this is actually my second python work (the first one is for dgtle.com), and it is already the second version! <br>
Referencing some other examples, however, theirs seems not to work very well on my computer. <br>
Therefore, I decided to start from scratch, and try to make it my own way to achieve the goal. <br>
I fixed a lot of mistakes, by considering more potential issues, therefore, this code worked much more durable, and can handle almost any page on that website.<br>
As you may see, there is no function and multiprocessing in my code, just because I am very new to this field, and I don’t have any confidence in their performance.<br>
Once I learned enough, I will re-write the code to adopt those new features, to make it work better.<br>
I personally do not desire to release any version before it has been fully tested.<br>
Anyway, it is a giant leap for myself. Satisfied.<br>

Make sure you installed the lxml and beautifulsoup on your computer, you will need these libraries to make the code work.<br>

## INSTRUCTION:
1. PUT ALL THE URL OF EACH WEBPAGE INTO A TEXT FILE.
for example:
### example.txt
```
https://www.vmgirls.com/11001.html
https://www.vmgirls.com/10990.html
https://www.vmgirls.com/10979.html
https://www.vmgirls.com/10905.html
https://www.vmgirls.com/10870.html
https://www.vmgirls.com/10814.html
https://www.vmgirls.com/10800.html
https://www.vmgirls.com/10788.html
https://www.vmgirls.com/10777.html
https://www.vmgirls.com/10766.html
https://www.vmgirls.com/10754.html

```
2. PUT THAT TXT FILE UNDER THE SAME FOLDER AS THIS PY FILE.
for example:
```
D:\vmgirls\vmgirls.py
D:\vmgirls\example.txt
```

3. IN TERMINAL, USE "python vmgirls.py" AS START COMMAND.
```
D:\vmgirls\python vmgirls.py
```
4. THE IMAGES WILL BE DOWNLOADED INTO EACH SUB-FOLDER BY THEIR TITLE ON WEBPAGE UNDER THE FOLDER WHERE PYTHON FILE LOCATED.
for example:
```
