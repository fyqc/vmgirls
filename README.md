This is NOT a masterpiece, not even close.
I am practising my new learned skill on Python and trying to see if I can make things work.
Referencing some other examples, however, theirs seems not to work on my computer.
Therefore, I decided to start from scratch, and try to make it my own way to achieve the height.
I personally fixed a lot of their mistakes, to make it work on most pages, and this was my first attempt to use function and multiprocessing.

Anyway, it is a giant leap for myself.
Satisfied.
